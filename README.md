Module 3 Discussion about the Differences with Arrays and Array Lists

While arrays and array lists, particularly in java, sound like they may do the same things, there are many differences between them. First off, arrays are fixed in size. Arrays are used to store different elements of the same data types. On the other hand, array lists are much more flexible in size and are a part of the Java Collections Framework (JFC). The JFC is a piece of architecture within the java.util package that establishes standardized classes and interfaces. Arrays cannot be added or removed within java, but array lists can. Another difference is that while both are similarly quick to access, array lists do, at times, come with occasional latency due to resizing. To summarize, the main differences are that array sizes are fixed while array lists are dynamic, arrays store primitives directly while array lists use wrapper classes like (int, double, etc), and arrays use .length while array lists use .size.
